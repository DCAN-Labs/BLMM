# Testing ReadMe

This folder contains all testing scripts I have used for testing BLMM. However, they did not originally belong to their current locations and as such the paths inside the files may be incorrect. I aim to resolve these shortly. Roughly speaking the folders are organised as so:

 - Functional: Running NeuroImaging examples based on the configuration files in cfg.
 - Unit: Running individual unit tests for each function (Todo: Many tests exist in rough form in the Python notebooks but do not yet exist in function form).
